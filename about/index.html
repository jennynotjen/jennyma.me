      <h4>I'm Chinese by birth, Canadian by culture, and American according to my income tax. I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo in Canada, with a minor in combinatorics & optimization (long-name-for-math). Currently, I'm a product management intern at the Excel team at Microsoft. In a few months, I'll be off to Amsterdam to begin an study term abroad! I love being a mixed bag of cultures, and can't wait to add more to the bag!</h4>
